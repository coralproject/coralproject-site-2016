# How to Install

To run our products, you need to install them on your own server.

This is a multi-step process, documented within our technical documentation [here](http://docs.coralproject.net).

If you need assistance, please email our [Integration Engineer.](mailto:jeff@mozillafoundation.org)

We do not currently offer a hosted/license and delivery service. If you're interested in such a service for your newsroom, please [email jeff@mozillafoundation.org](mailto:jeff@mozillafoundation.org) and we'll be in touch when we have more news.
