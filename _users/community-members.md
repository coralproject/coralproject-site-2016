# For Community Members

## Control your experience

By using our simple Talk filters, you can customize your comment experience to focus on what you want to read.

## Interact with the newsroom

Improve journalism by sharing your knowledge and skills directly with journalists. Through our tools, journalists can spend more time reading and responding to your contributions.

## Avoid abuse 

Privacy and anti-harassment features are at the core of our tools. Our Ask tool will allow you to opt out from publicly sharing information. Our Trust tool makes it easier for newsrooms to handle abuse and trolling. Our Talk tool keeps you closer to conversations that you want to read and participate in, and away from those that you don’t.
